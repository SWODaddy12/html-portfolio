<h1>The Best Movies According to Tom</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Braveheart</h3>
<p>
  A great display of what a powerful effect one can have on others when you have
  a single minded focus on what is right.
</p>
<h3>We Were Soldiers</h3>
<p>
  An outstanding portrayal of effective leadership, especially when having to
  work without the tools, resources, and proper preparation to do the job.
</p>
<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>
<p>
  A beautiful film about getting out of your own head and enjoying life in the
  moment.
