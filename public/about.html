<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Tom! I plan and schedule projects varying in size and scope. I love
  coffee, reading and learning, and narrative storytelling.
</p>

<p>
  I'm getting into web development and really enjoying it. Computers and
  programming have always been a light hobby for me, and the deeper I go, the
  more I like it.
</p>

<p>See you on the net!</p>
